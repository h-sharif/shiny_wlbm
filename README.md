# R Shiny Dashboard for Water Quality Management at Mina Los Bronces

> Developed for the Mina Los Bronces copper mine as part of 2023 WLBM updating project at Robertson GeoConsultants Inc.

## Introduction
This dashboard aids in decision-making by identifying improved remediation practices for contaminated surface water—carrying sulfate, copper, and manganese—impacting the surrounding environment near Santiago, Chile. The Water and Load Balance Model (WLBM) is crucial for understanding and managing these environmental challenges.

## Key Features
- Interactive visualizations of water quality metrics
- User-friendly interface for exploring geospatial data using Leaflet
- Insights into remediation practices and their effectiveness

## Version History
- Initial dashboard with only six key outlets (WLBM model nodes) deployed to *ploomber.io* servers (October 2024)

## Accessing the Dashboard

Dashboard UI can be examined with `runGitHub("shiny_wlbm", "h-sharif")` in R. However, access to the deployed version and WLBM simulation data are currently restricted.
